Suppose we want to entertain ourselves by watching a turtle wander around randomly inside the screen. 
When we run the program we want the turtle and program to behave in the following way:

The turtle begins in the center of the screen.

Flip a coin. If it’s heads then turn to the left 90 degrees. If it’s tails then turn to the right 90 degrees.

Take 50 steps forward.

If the turtle has moved outside the screen then stop, otherwise go back to step 2 and repeat.

Notice that we cannot predict how many times the turtle will need to flip the coin before it wanders out of the screen,
so we can’t use a for loop in this case. In fact, although very unlikely, this program might never end, that is why we 
call this indefinite iteration.

import random
import turtle


def isInScreen(w, t):
    rightbound = wn.window_width()/2
    leftbound = -(wn.window_width()/2)
    topbound = wn.window_height()/2
    bottombound = -(wn.window_height()/2)

    turtleX = t.xcor()
    turtleY = t.ycor()

    stillIn = True
    if turtleX > rightbound or turtleX < leftbound:
        stillIn =  False
    if turtleY > topbound or turtleY < bottombound:
        stillIn = False
    return stillIn

wn = turtle.Screen()
tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.shape("turtle")
tess.color("blue")

while isInScreen(wn,tess) :
    coin = random.randrange(0,2)
    if coin == 0:
        tess.right(90)
    else:
        tess.left(90)
        tess.forward(50)
wn.exitonclick()
